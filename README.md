# VibeSec ⚡🔒

A VS Code extension that scans your code for security issues — powered by [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) and designed for developers who move fast.



---

## What It Does

1. Open a file in VS Code
2. Pick it in the **Scan panel** or just run **"VibeSec: Scan Current File"**
3. The extension runs Semgrep in the background
4. Security issues appear as **inline highlights** directly in your code
5. Results show up in the **Findings panel** grouped by folder and file
6. Click any finding to jump to the exact line — or copy its description to clipboard

No accounts. No cloud. No telemetry. Everything runs on your machine.

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.85 or later
- [Semgrep CLI](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) installed and on your PATH
- Node.js 18+ (for extension development only)

### Install Semgrep

```bash
# macOS / Linux
pip install semgrep

# or via Homebrew
brew install semgrep

# Windows
pip install semgrep
```

Verify it works:
```bash
semgrep --version
```

---

## Getting Started (Development)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moawiah188/vibesec.git
cd vibesec
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Compile

```bash
npm run compile
```

### 4. Run in VS Code

1. Open the `vibesec` folder in VS Code
2. Press **F5**
3. A second VS Code window opens — this is your test environment
4. Open any file and run **Ctrl+Shift+P → VibeSec: Scan Current File**

---

## Try It With the Sample File

The repo includes an intentionally insecure Python file for testing:

```
test-samples/insecure.py
```

Open it in the Extension Development Host and run a scan. You should see findings for:
- Command injection via `subprocess` and `os.system`
- Weak hashing with MD5 and SHA-1
- Hardcoded credentials and API keys
- SQL injection via string formatting
- Insecure deserialization with `pickle`
- Unsafe `yaml.load()`
- Insecure randomness with `random.random()`
- Code injection via `eval` and `exec`

---

## Policy File (`.vibesec.yaml`)

Drop a `.vibesec.yaml` in your project root to control how VibeSec scans your code.

```yaml
# Which rule packs to use
presets:
  - vibesec:default        # Bundled OWASP rules — works offline

# Minimum severity to report
severity:
  minSeverity: warning     # error | warning | info

# Exclude paths from scanning
files:
  exclude:
    - "**/node_modules/**"
    - "**/*.test.ts"

# Add your own inline rules
rules:
  - id: my-custom-rule
    message: "Don't use eval()"
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [javascript]
    pattern: eval(...)
```

Use **Ctrl+Shift+P → VibeSec: Open Policy File** to create one with a starter template.
Use **VibeSec: Reload Policy** to pick up changes without restarting VS Code.

## Taint Analysis

VibeSec ships a bundled **taint ruleset** that tracks how untrusted data flows from a *source* (HTTP request body, command-line argument, environment variable, file read) through variable assignments and helper calls to a *sink* (shell exec, SQL query, deserializer, outbound HTTP). This catches bugs that line-by-line pattern matching misses — e.g. when user input is read on line 12, stored in a variable, and only reaches `subprocess.run` on line 47.

**Enable it** by adding `vibesec:taint` to your `.vibesec.yaml`:

```yaml
presets:
  - vibesec:default
  - vibesec:taint
```

Bundled rules cover **command injection**, **SQL injection**, **path traversal**, **unsafe deserialization** (pickle / yaml), **XSS**, and **SSRF** for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.

When a taint rule fires, the finding card shows a dedicated **Data flow** block:
- ① **SOURCE** — where the untrusted data enters
- ② **STEP N** — any intermediate variable assignments along the path
- ③ **SINK** — the dangerous call

Click any row to jump straight to that line. The AI fix prompt automatically includes the full data-flow path, so the assistant knows exactly where to add validation or sanitisation.

---

## AI Fix Prompts

After a scan, VibeSec can generate a copy-paste prompt you paste into Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant to get a fix back.

**Setup (one time):**
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **VibeSec: Set API Key** — pick your provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini) and paste your key. It's stored securely using VS Code's built-in secret storage and never written to disk.
2. Open **Settings → VibeSec** and choose your preferred **Prompt Mode**:
   - **Per File** *(default)* — one prompt per file, batching all findings in it
   - **Per Vulnerability** — one prompt per individual finding
   - **Per Project** — one prompt covering every finding across the whole scan

**Generating prompts:**
- Click the **$(sparkle) Generate Prompts** button in the Findings panel title bar to pre-generate all prompts at once
- Or hover any finding/file row and click the **$(comment-discussion) Copy Prompt** button to generate and copy on demand — no upfront cost

Prompts include the offending code with context lines, rule details, and instructions for the AI to explain the issue, show a corrected snippet, and list follow-up checks.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- VS Code Extension API
- Semgrep CLI
- `js-yaml` — policy file parsing
- `minimatch` — glob-based file exclusions
- Node 18+ built-in `fetch` — LLM API calls (no extra HTTP library)

No backend. No database. No cloud infrastructure. Your API key stays on your machine.
